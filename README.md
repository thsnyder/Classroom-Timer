Classroom Timer Chrome Extension
Classroom Timer is a quick, simple visual timer for teachers and classrooms to open and set a timer in a distraction-free experience.

When the extension is installed, clicking the extension icon will open a new Chrome tab with an empty timer on a random gradient backgroound for the user to set minutes and seconds.
